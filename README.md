# rag-project

Repository for local RAG utilities: audio transcription, chunking, and retrieval workflows used for experiments.

## Notes
- This repo excludes large audio/video files by default (`audio/`, `video/`).
- See individual scripts for usage: `stt.py`, `process_video.py`, `format.py`, etc.

## Quick start
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
2. Install dependencies (if you have a `requirements.txt`)
3. Run scripts as needed
